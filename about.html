      <p>Hi, I’m Blake Curby — the creative behind Blake Curby Creative. I studied at Billy Blue College of Design in Sydney and have been telling visual stories through photo and video for over a decade. My work has taken me all across Australia and overseas, collaborating with incredible clients and capturing everything from live music to intimate weddings and commercial projects.</p>
      <p>I strive to create a relaxed environment on every shoot, connecting with people and making them feel comfortable in front of the lens. Outside of my creative work, I perform in a band called Irken Armada — music fuels my creative spirit and adds another layer of passion to everything I do.</p>
