    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Blake Curby — a creative problem solver. I studied at Billy Blue College of Design (Torrens University) in Sydney, Australia and have been telling visual stories through photo and video for over a decade.</p>
    <p>My work has taken me all across Australia and overseas, collaborating with incredible clients and capturing everything from live music to intimate weddings and commercial projects.</p>
    <p>I strive to create a relaxed environment on every shoot, connecting with people and making them feel comfortable in front of the lens.</p>
    <p>Outside of my creative work, I perform in a band called Irken Armada — music fuels my creative spirit and adds another layer of passion to everything I do.</p>
